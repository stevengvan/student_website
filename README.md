# Student Website

This project is a portfolio made while taking a web development course at the university I attended. The portfolio was created using only HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with the design requirement being an accessible and responsive website for all platforms.

## Launching Website

The website can simply be launched by opening the HTML file in a browser.

The website can also be viewed from this link: [https://stevengvan.github.io/student_website/](https://stevengvan.github.io/student_website/)
